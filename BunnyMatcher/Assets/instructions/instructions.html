        A topic, such as <span class="topic">Fruit</span> 
        is shown at the top of the screen.
        A grid of words appears below the topic, such as the words:
        <span class="word">brother</span>, 
        <span class="word topic-word">apple</span>, and 
        <span class="word">red</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Touch the words that
        match the topic. The <span class="character hero">bunny</span> 
        will run towards that word. Avoid
        the <span class="character enemy">fox</span>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Touch all of the words that fit with that topic to 
        move to the next topic.
